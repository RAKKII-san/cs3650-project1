CS3650 Project 1 - Michael Left, Austin Celestino, Sean Chuang

This project consists of a single-cycle implementation of a MIPS processor
in Verilog. It handles a basic subset of instructions: ALU functions, lw/sw,
beq, jump.

A txt file is included to test out the Verilog processor. This was also provided by
fpga4student.com. Screenshots from local testing are provided by group members.
