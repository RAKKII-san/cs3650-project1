CS3650 Project 1: Certified Preowned Processor - Michael Left, Austin Celestino, Sean Chuang

This project consists of a pipelined implementation of a MIPS processor
in Verilog. It handles a basic subset of instructions: ALU functions, lw/sw,
beq, jump.

This project is not an original recreation of a MIPS processor; rather, it serves
as a learning experience and seeks to gain more understanding in Verilog.
Our project uses fpga4student.com's implementation to examine how
single-cycle and 5-stage pipelining is done in Verilog.

A txt file is included to test out the Verilog processor. This was also provided by
fpga4student.com. Screenshots from local testing are provided by us.
